# Horses and Humans image classifier using tensorflow
This is just a image classifier for finding the difference between horses and humans.
I just built this using the basic method of image classifier using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
with the basic example method of image classifier so we can improve this method if you want.
I took the images for training from the keggle<br>
[Horses Or Humans Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sanikamal/horses-or-humans-dataset)<br>
[Google Image Loading](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/classification)<br>
[Tweaking the optimizer](https://keras.io/api/optimizers/)</br>

## TODO
- [x] Write a test script
- [x] Write a test script for real images
- [ ] Write a video image classifier
